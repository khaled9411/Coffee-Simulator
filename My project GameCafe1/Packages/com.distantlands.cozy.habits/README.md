# üìñ Overview
Habits gives you full control over the calendar with more features (such as days of the week, accurate and extensible months, easier display, and revamped UI) as well as an improved events system with graphical scheduling, custom repeating structures, event calling based on the start time, end time, etc., fully accurate event timing down to the minute, and a new profile based architecture that allows for easy cross-scene event manipulation.
