# üìñ Overview
Bring new depth to your skies with fully volumetric clouds for COZY: Weather 3! PLUME uses a cell-based chunk system that effectively generates cloud particles

- Extend your COZY system with onboard tools:
- Cell-based procedurally generated volumetric clouds
- Automatic chunk generation, culling, and pooling make for quick cloud generation at any altitude, speed, or location
- Bend your clouds to the horizon to give the illusion of a curved planet
- Use the profile system to design your own cloud types
- Automatically animate according to a custom wind speed and direction
- Combine normals of nearby chunks automatically to make large cohesive clouds
- Generate colliders for clouds
- Accurate cloud shadows
- Spread out noise calculations to increase performance
- Use with or without COZY's default cloud types

# üìê Setup Guide
If you are using URP, be sure to import the inlcluded URP package for the shaders. To use Plume, simply add the Plume module to your COZY system in the settings and modules tab!
